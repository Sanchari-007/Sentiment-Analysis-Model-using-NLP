# Sentiment-Analysis-Model-using-NLP
This project involves building a sentiment analysis model to classify textual data into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. Leveraging powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project includes data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming), feature extraction using TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer, and model training with machine learning algorithm such as Random Forest (We also can use Decision Tree, and XGBoost). The sentiment polarity can be further analyzed using VADER Sentiment Analyzer to enhance prediction accuracy. Visualizations can be implemented using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud for better interpretability of results.
